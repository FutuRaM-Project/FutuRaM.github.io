**Pursuant to milestone 11, the following is a draft report describing the future scenarios for FutuRaM.**
<br>  
Date: 2023-06-12

## I. Introduction

The FutuRaM project seeks to quantify the current and future availability of secondary raw materials
(SRM) with a focus on critical raw materials (CRM) for six waste streams.

These are:

- waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE)  
- waste batteries (BAT)  
- end-of-life vehicles (ELV)  
- mining waste (MIN)  
- slags and ashes (SLASH)  
- construction and demolition (CDW)  

Work package 2 (WP2) is conducting foresight studies for materials critical to the EU economy, or materials that have significant impacts on EU sustainability because of their large volumes.

WP2 is developing a set of coherent scenarios for material use and waste/recovery over time in various sectors in the EU.

This report describes the three scenarios and the process by which they were developed.  

The scenarios are:

- Business as usual (BAU)
- Recovery (REC)
- Circularity (CIR)

## II. Executive summary

This report presents the first phase of the scenario development process – the storyline narrative phase. Three distinct future scenarios have been drafted up to the year 2050, Business as usual, Recovery and Circularity. The scenarios are designed to be internally consistent and to provide a overview of the potential future landscape of waste management and SRM recovery within the EU. The scenario development process employs a methodology that integrates both forecasting and backcasting techniques to construct a comprehensive, future-facing knowledge base that can aid fact-based decision-making.

**Business as Usual (BAU):**  
The BAU scenario extends the current situation into the future with limited deviation from existing patterns. Utilising backcasting and forecasting techniques, it assesses a potential future where there might be minor advancements in resource efficiency, recovery technology, and energy transition, but where primary extraction of raw materials remains the primary practice.  

**Recovery:**  
The Recovery scenario envisions a future that employs sophisticated technology to dramatically enhance SRM recovery from waste streams. It presents a future where the EU successfully meets its recycling and recovery targets through an effective waste management system and circular design principles. The scenario envisions an increased recovery rate of SRMs, extensive use of digitalisation and automation in recycling processes, and the implementation of new waste regulations in alignment with EU targets.  

**Circularity:**  
The Circularity scenario encapsulates the fullest possible realisation of a circular economy, extending beyond end-of-life recovery of materials to minimising waste at all stages of production and consumption. It envisions a future where the EU's targets for recycling, recovery, and circularity are met through extensive stakeholder collaboration, the emergence of new business models, and increased use of renewable energy and circular economy technologies.  

In subsequent phases of the scenario development process, future product composition and recovery technology will be examined, scenario elements will be quantified, and all scenario data will be integrated and coupled with the quantitative models for waste generation and SRM recovery.  

Through the development of these scenarios, the FutuRaM project aims to provide a nuanced understanding of the potential future waste management and resource recovery landscape within the EU. This approach offers insights into key drivers, uncertainties, and the potential impacts of policy interventions and technological advancements. By aligning SRM recovery projects more closely with the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources (UNFC), the project aims to enable the commercial exploitation of SRMs and CRMs by manufacturers, recyclers, and investors. Ultimately, the comprehensive knowledge base developed through this process is designed to support and inform the decision-making processes of policymakers and governmental authorities.

## IV. Summary of scenario storylines

### Scenario I: Business as usual (BAU) <!-- omit in toc -->

See [Section 3.1](#31-scenario-1-business-as-usual) for the full scenario description waste stream specific scenario impact narratives.

This scenario envisions the future based on the current situation, extending to 2050 with very little deviation from present consumption patterns and the secondary raw material (SRM) system. While there may be advances in some areas such as resource efficiency, recovery technology, and the energy transition, substantial modifications remain hindered by economic, social, and political constraints. The primary extraction of raw materials continues to be the primary source to meet the EU's demand.

In the Business as usual (linear economy) scenario, the following are key characteristics:

- A forecasting model is used to predict the future based on the current situation and the development of existing trends.
- EU targets including those for recycling and recovery are not met, and the current linear model largely persists.
- Material demand keeps pace with GDP growth, perpetuating a trend of increasing consumption.Primary mining and extraction persist as the leading sources of raw materials, underlining the dependency on traditional extraction methods.
- Recycling and recovery rates continue to lag, leading to an accumulation of SRM waste that signals missed opportunities for resource reuse.
- The environmental repercussions of mining and extraction, such as land degradation and water pollution, continue to be a pressing concern, reflecting the ecological toll of this linear model.
- The EU's dependency on imports of SRMs escalates, heightening the risk of supply disruptions.Investment in new SRM recovery technologies remains minimal, stifling innovation and advancements in this field.
- The industrial focus remains on cost-effective material production and use, disregarding the long-term sustainability aspect.
- Material scarcity and price fluctuations pose potential risks to the EU industry, highlighting the vulnerability of this business model.
- Without any significant updates to environmental regulations, the negative impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity intensify.
- Working conditions in mining and extraction industries see no substantial improvements, highlighting continued issues of social inequality.
- The EU's reliance on fossil fuels continues, with the energy transition progressing at a slow pace.
- The EU's dependency on imports of SRMs escalates, heightening the risk of supply disruptions.

### Scenario II: Recovery <!-- omit in toc -->

See [Section 3.2](#32-scenario-2-recovery) for the full scenario description and the waste stream specific scenario impact narratives.

In the recovery scenario, the central emphasis is on harnessing sophisticated technologies to salvage SRMs from waste streams at the end of their lifecycle. While there are noticeable strides towards the incorporation of 'circular design' principles and re-X strategies (which focus on reducing, reusing, recycling, repairing, and refurbishing), a vestige of wasteful consumerism, akin to the one observed in the BAU scenario, still lingers. However, this is somewhat mitigated by the implementation of a comprehensive material recovery system.

Key characteristics of this technology promoted recovery scenario include:

- This scenario uses a combination of the forecasting and backcasting methods to envision the future.
- The backcasting method is used for scenario factors that are covered by governmental targets, starting with the desired outcome and working backwards to the present.
- The forecasting method is used for scenario factors that are not covered by governmental targets, starting with the current situation and extending to the future.
- EU targets for recycling and recovery are met, due to the EU's waste management system becoming more expansive, efficient and effective.
- Technological innovation drives increased recovery rates of SRMs, enabling the more efficient use of waste.
- Digitalisation and automation are more extensively used in recycling processes, leading to enhanced productivity and accuracy.
- There is greater exploration and exploitation of alternative sources such as urban mining, waste streams, and tailings, presenting novel opportunities for resource acquisition.
- New waste regulations and guidelines for SRM recovery are implemented, enforcing better management and extraction of SRMs.
- Investment in research and development for SRM recovery technologies experiences an upswing, promoting continuous innovation in this field.
- Closer collaboration and information sharing between industry and government institutions streamline processes and expedite decision-making.
- New jobs are created in the recycling and recovery sector, offering economic benefits and improving overall employment rates.
- SRM production and use become more efficient and cost-effective, fostering economic sustainability.
- Environmental impact from mining and extraction is reduced, signaling a more sustainable approach to resource acquisition.

### Scenario III: Circularity <!-- omit in toc -->

See [Section 3.3](#33-scenario-3-circularity) for the full scenario description and the waste stream specific scenario impact narratives.

In this scenario, we move in the direction of the maximum achievable state of material efficiency as government policy, private innovation and social changes are rapidly driving the transition toward a circular economy. The emphasis here rests heavily on re-X strategies that are implemented in the design phase of products (e.g., repairability and re-manufacturability) and that are actualised by changes in consumer behaviour (e.g reduction, refusal, engagement in the ‘sharing-economy’ and curtailment of the ‘throw-away’ mindset). Further, being enabled by the widespread adoption of ‘circular design’ principles and improvements in information transparency (e.g., waste tracking and digital product passports) the system for the treatment of post-consumer waste can divert a significant amount of their inflows (to, for example, re-use and re-manufacture) with the residual fraction being readily segregated into purer, more efficiently recoverable, material streams. This scenario envisions a future where government policies are in synergy with private sector innovation and societal changes, driving a wholesale transition towards a circular economy. Unlike the recovery scenario, where the focus is on the end-of-life recovery of materials, this scenario emphasises minimising waste at all stages, starting from the design phase itself.

The circular economy scenario is characterised by the following:

- This scenario uses a combination of the forecasting and backcasting methods to envision the future.
- The backcasting method is used for scenario factors that are covered by governmental targets, starting with the desired outcome and working backwards to the present.
- The forecasting method is used for scenario factors that are not covered by governmental targets, starting with the current situation and extending to the future.
- EU targets for recycling and recovery are met, as are those for circularity, due advances in waste management, ecodesign and re-X strategies.
- A circular economy is implemented, prioritising waste reduction, resource efficiency, and a shift from the 'take-make-dispose' model.
- A notable increase in SRM recycling and recovery rates, indicating an efficient use of resources.
- A larger emphasis on designing products for reuse and recycling, making waste a valuable resource rather than a problem.
- More extensive use of renewable energy and clean technologies in SRM production and use, supporting a low-carbon economy.
- Collaboration between stakeholders, including industry, government, and consumers, improves, enhancing the implementation of circular practices.
- New business models like leasing and take-back schemes emerge, altering traditional consumption patterns.
- Digitalisation and data use are heightened to improve efficiency and traceability, aiding in effective resource management.
- Investment in research and development for circular economy technologies increases, driving innovation and adoption.
- Awareness and education around sustainable consumption and production practices are amplified, leading to behavioural changes in society.
- Environmental impacts from mining and extraction reduce, and reliance on imports decreases, suggesting greater self-sufficiency and sustainability.

[Back to Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

This task involves scanning, mapping, and assessing scenarios used in the grey, scientific, policy, and industry literature/reporting for the different waste streams, (e.g. the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways, the International Resource Panel Scenarios, the International Energy Agency Scenarios, etc) to develop cogent storylines for the three planned scenarios. These will cut across sectors and will be used for the Stock-Flow models (WP4) and will include the translation of general concepts such as stated policies, sustainable development, circular economy, to each sector. FutuRaM will develop at minimum three scenarios (1. Sustainability, 2. Recoverability, and 3. Business-as-usual).

## 2. Methodology

### A conceptual framework for scenario development  <!-- omit in toc -->

[Back to Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)  

The conceptual framework for scenario development is based on the following principles.

The scenarios should:

- Be based on the best available scientific knowledge and data.
- Provide a coherent and consistent picture of the future.
- Provide decision makers with knowledge related to the possible consequences of their decisions.
- Consider a range of plausible future outcomes, accounting for uncertainties and alternative trajectories.
- Be developed in a participatory and collaborative manner, involving relevant stakeholders and experts.
- Be transparent and well-documented, allowing for replication and further analysis.
- Be flexible and adaptable, allowing for updates and adjustments as new information becomes available.

By adhering to these principles, the FutuRaM project aims to develop robust, informative, and policy-relevant scenarios that support sustainable decision-making and contribute to the transition towards a more circular and resource-efficient economy. The methodology ensures that the scenarios capture the complexity and interconnectedness of the waste streams, taking into account various factors such as legislation, technology, geopolitics, and societal values. Ultimately, the goal is to provide decision makers with valuable insights and tools to navigate the challenges and opportunities associated with secondary raw materials in a rapidly changing world.

### Scenario storyline development process <!-- omit in toc -->

Building scenarios involves several steps and methodologies, which can vary depending on the specific context and objectives. The following section provides an overview of the scenario development process used in FutuRaM.

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

#### 2.1.1. Scope and objectives of the scenario development process  

The scope and objectives of the scenario development process is defined in the context of the overall aim, scope and objectives of the FutuRaM project.

<br>

**Aim**:

> FutuRaM will develop the Secondary Raw Materials knowledge base on the availability and recoverability of secondary raw materials (SRMs) within the European Union (EU), with a special focus on critical raw materials (CRMs). The project research will enable fact-based decision making for the recovery and use of SRMs within and outside the EU, and disseminate the data generated via an accessible knowledge base developed in the project.

<br>

**Scope**:

> FutuRaM will establish a methodology, reporting structure, and guidance to improve the raw materials knowledge base up to 2050. FutuRaM will focus on six waste streams: batteries; electrical and electronic equipment; vehicles; mining; slags and ashes; and construction and demolition. It will integrate SRM and CRM data to model their current stocks and flows, and consider economic, technological, geopolitical, regulatory, social and environmental factors to further develop, demonstrate and align SRM recovery projects with the United Nations Framework Classification for Resources (UNFC), a tool that enables a better understanding of the viability of raw material projects. This will enable the commercial exploitation of SRMs and CRMs by manufacturers, recyclers, and investors, and the knowledge base developed in the project will support policy makers and governmental authorities.

| A successful transition to a climate-neutral, circular and digitised EU economy relies heavily on a secure supply of raw materials. In order to strengthen EU autonomy and reduce over-dependency, we must boost domestic sourcing, both for primary and SRMs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | FutuRaM will quantify the future availability of SRMs for three future scenarios for the EU material economy, from following current consumption trends, to moderate or rapid transitioning toward a climate-neutral, circular, and digitised EU economy (WP2). The material demand and the SRMs supply for each scenario and raw material imports to evaluate EU material autonomy.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| Presently, several socioeconomic scenarios have been developed at national, EU, and/or global scales to assess the energy and mobility transition.3 While some of these studies have partially included CRMs demand and focused on the potential supply risks for achieving climate targets, these prospective scenarios have not been effectively harmonised across industrial sectors, and generally lack information on SRMs and the recovery industry in general. Transitions toward sustainable societies are likely to involve major changes and increased complexity in the material economy. Further research into current and future SRMs and CRMs present in the urban mine is thus urgent to prepare industry for their eventual recovery. In addition, scenarios that include other Circular goals such as lifetime extension need to be better assessed in terms of material cycles. | FutuRaM will develop stock-flow models for six waste streams based on holistic scenarios to map current and future material use in the economy of the EU-27 plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and United Kingdom (EU27+4) and quantify their eventual end-of-life fate. FutuRaM will extend existing model approaches by a set of distinct scenarios which cover circular economy (e.g. lifetime extension through repair and remanufacturing), high SRMs recoverability, and business as usual. These scenarios will incorporate emerging recycling technologies in line with stakeholder dialogues that consider normative boundary conditions such as carbon neutrality by 2050. |

**Scope definition**:

Given this context, the scope of the scenario development process is to develop a set of plausible scenarios that explore the future of waste management, resource recovery, and circular economy in the EU. The scenarios will be used to identify key drivers and uncertainties that will influence the future of waste management and resource recovery. The scenarios will also be used to evaluate the potential impacts of different policy interventions and technological advancements.

*Thematic scope*
The scenarios are be centred on the six waste streams of FutuRaM: WEEE, ELV, BAT, CDW, MIN, and SLASH. Additionally, consideration will be given to sectors and policy domains that are relevant to these waste streams and the general context of the system. These include manufacturing, energy, transportation, as well as policy related to the environment, the economy, society, technology, and geopolitics.

*Geographic scope*
The scenarios will be developed for the EU-27 plus Iceland, Norway, Switzerland and United Kingdom (EU27+4). The scenarios will consider the current and future waste management practices and resource recovery technologies in these countries. Additionally, the scenarios will consider the current and future policies and targets related to waste management and resource efficiency in these countries. To some extent, the scenarios will also consider the current and future trade relationships between these countries and other countries around the world.

*Temporal scope*
The scenarios will be developed for the time horizon of 2025-2050. This time horizon is aligned with the long term targets of the EU, including the EU Green Deal, the EU Circular Economy Action Plan, and the EU Industrial Strategy. The discrete stages in the forecasts is planned to be: 2025, 2030, 2035, 2040, 2045 and 2050. The temporal resolution of the scenarios will be determined during the quantification phase of the scenario development process. While it is possible to develop scenarios with a high (or even continuous) temporal resolution, that of these scenarios will be determined based on the availability and quality of data. It is important to acknowledge that providing too high a temporal resolution may lead to a false sense of accuracy and precision.

**Aims and objectives definition**
The specific objectives that the FutuRaM scenarios aim to achieve presented in the following table.

| Aim                                                                                                                                                                                        | Objective                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |

#### 2.1.2 Consideration of EU legislation and policy targets  

  The scenarios developed in FutuRaM includes the targets that the EU is setting for specific elements/materials/waste streams, following, in particular, the ambitions of the EU Green Deal @cite{EU2019} and the proposed critical raw materials (CRM) legislation @cite{EU2023}. Additionally, the consumer-product-centric waste streams BATT, ELV, and WEEE have specific EU legislation that will be considered in the scenarios.  

##### 2.1.2.1. General policies and legislation  

 **The EU Green Deal** is a set of policy initiatives by the European Commission with the overarching aim of making Europe climate neutral in 2050. This policy portfolio is a response to the Paris Agreement and the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals and it covers a wide range of economic sectors with an emphasis on investments toward building up local, 'sustainable' industries. The scope of FutuRaM is aligned with the EU Green Deal's goal of ensuring the sustainable sourcing and use of raw materials, reducing dependency on imports, and promoting resource security.

 **The EU Circular Economy Action Plan** is a policy framework developed by the European Commission to promote the circular economy in the European Union. It sets out a comprehensive set of measures and targets to improve resource efficiency, reduce waste, and foster sustainable production and consumption. The Action Plan includes initiatives related to product design, waste management, recycling, and resource efficiency, among others. The Action Plan is a key element of the European Green Deal and it is closely linked to the EU Industrial Strategy.

The plan:

- Aims to promote the transition to a more circular economy in the EU
- Sets out a range of measures to promote the sustainable use of resources, reduce waste, and increase recycling
- Includes proposals for new legislation, such as an EU-wide framework for the circular economy, and revisions to existing legislation, such as the WEEE Directive
- Emphasizes the importance of product design for the circular economy, and proposes measures to promote eco-design and repairability
- Includes initiatives to promote the use of secondary raw materials, such as the establishment of a European Raw Materials Alliance
- Aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve resource efficiency in the EU
Calls for increased cooperation and dialogue among stakeholders in the circular economy.  

**The Critical Raw Materials Act** is a proposed EU regulation that aims to ensure a secure and sustainable supply of raw materials to the EU. The Act identifies a list of strategic raw materials, which are crucial to technologies important to Europe's green and digital ambitions and for defence and space applications, that are subject to potential supply risks. The regulation will cover the entire raw materials value chain, from primary extraction to manufacture to its potential recovery as a secondary raw material.
  
By 2030, one single ex-EU country shall produce not more than 65% of the EU's annual consumption of each strategic raw material.  
Clear benchmarks have been set for domestic capacities of the EU in 2030:  

- extract at least 10% of the EU's annual consumption  
- process at least 40% of the EU's annual consumption  
- recycle at least 15% of the EU's annual consumption  

These benchmarks have been included in the scenarios developed in FutuRaM. Specifically, in the Recovery scenario, where the emphasis is on the recovery of materials from waste streams and the Circularity scenario where the emphasis is on the the implementation of 're-X' strategies, such as recycling, remanufacturing, and reuse. These benchmarks are considered too optimistic to be included in the Business-as-usual scenario.

##### 2.1.2.2.  Waste stream specific legislation and policy targets

With respect to the waste streams that are analysed in FutuRaM, the following waste stream-specific developments aligned with EU targets have been considered:

- BATT: Proposed revision of the Batteries Directive (2020/0353(COD)) {Vivienne2022}
  - Establishes rules for the collection, treatment, and recycling of batteries and accumulators in the EU
  - Requires Member States to set up collection and recycling systems for waste batteries and accumulators
  - Sets specific recycling targets for different types of batteries and accumulators
  - Prohibits the use of certain hazardous substances in the manufacturing of batteries and accumulators
  - Requires labeling and information for consumers on the proper disposal of batteries and accumulators
  - Requires producers to take responsibility for the costs of collecting, treating, and recycling waste batteries and accumulators
  - Aims to reduce the environmental impact of batteries and accumulators throughout their life cycle.
  
- ELV: Proposed revision currently under review now and to be completed during 2023:
  - Sets out rules for the collection, treatment, and recycling of end-of-life vehicles (ELV) in the EU
  - Requires Member States to set up collection systems for ELV and ensure that they are treated and recycled in an environmentally sound manner
  - Sets collection and recycling targets for ELV: 85% of the weight of each vehicle must be reused or recycled, and 95% of the weight of each vehicle must be reused, recycled, or recovered
  
- WEEE Directive (about to be evaluated with a review likely in 2024):
  - Sets out rules for the collection, treatment, and recycling of waste electrical and electronic equipment (WEEE) in the EU
  - Requires Member States to establish collection systems for WEEE and ensure that it is treated and recycled in an environmentally sound manner
  - Sets collection and recycling targets for different types of WEEE
  - Requires producers to take responsibility for the costs of treating and recycling WEEE
  - Requires the use of the waste hierarchy for WEEE management
  - Aims to prevent the generation of WEEE and promote its reuse and recycling
  - Requires the labeling of electrical and electronic equipment to facilitate its proper disposal.  
- CDW: No activity currently planned.  
- MIN: Focus is currently on human health and environmental impact rather than waste.  
- SLASH: No activity currently planned.  

#### 2.1.2.3. Extent of policy and legislation inclusion in the scenarios

The targets that result from the planned and ongoing review processes are non-negotiable and legally binding, and thus should be incorporated in our scenarios. These targets, however, are only applicable to post-consumer products, namely WEEE, BAT and ELV. This envisioned future in which legally binding targets for collection, reuse and/or material recycling are achieved can be implemented as the Recovery scenario. If there are no targets set for a specific consumer product category, then approach targets similar to the WEEE directive and in line with the EU Green Deal. For the Circularity scenario, FutuRaM will also consider the effects of proposed ecodesign requirements for sustainable products (e.g. longer lifetimes, increased reusability, repairability, recyclability).

However, for waste that that does not consist of discarded consumer products, but instead results from industrial production activities, in particular for MinW, and for SLASH, we must still produce specific scenarios related to mining, metallurgy, and waste and fuel combustion. The scenarios will account for increasing resource use effectiveness and production process efficiency, thus indicating lower volumes and quality of generated production residues (both by-products and waste such as red mud, waste rock, slags, etc) per unit of product (expressed either as product mass or product value), whether that product is a metal (e.g., a copper cathode), metal alloy (e.g. aluminium alloy n° 5183) or metal product (e.g. cold rolled stainless steel sheet). Ashes are highly diverse, and each specific type will have a specific storyline that is congruent within each scenario.

In conclusion, WEEE, ELV and BATT waste material recovery will follow the targets in the EU. For SLASH and MIN, we will evaluate recent trends in waste generation and extract plausible ranges of generation toward 2050. For CDW, embedded WEEE will follow EU targets, and bulk waste will incorporate storylines and scenarios that are congruent with those of SLASH and MIN. Various drivers will be assigned to move between these ranges and will be key to the specific, harmonised storyline for the scenario. Finally, the targets and storylines will be aligned with assumptions on technology development.

#### 2.1.3 Consideration of geopolitical developments

The storylines also attempt to consider geopolitical considerations and thus supply chain resiliency for satisfying the product demand in the scenarios. The growth in material demand for the energy and mobility transitions can be satisfied either by an increase of mining and metallurgy activities within the EU, or by growing imports from raw material producing countries outside the EU. That is, if we go for increased domestic EU production to minimise geopolitical supply risk, it may indicate more EU production residue generation even under an increased production efficiency and resource effectiveness. The increase of domestic industrial activity, as a response to an envisioned increased internal demand, supposes an equivalent rise of societal approval for mining and refining activities on EU territory. If the increased demand is, however, satisfied by imports from non-EU countries, the corresponding production residue volumes in the form of slags and ashes will also be generated outside the EU, while domestic volumes will decline, or at best, stabilise. FutuRaM is not conducting interviews and surveys, but we can do some literature analysis on the subject. It is likely that we will not be able to explicitly include this in our scenarios, but we can incorporate levels of acceptance by consumers for mining and refining activities in the European Union territory in our scenarios.  

### 2.2. Step 2: Determine methodology  

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

#### 2.2.1. Methodology types and selection criteria

The second step in the scenario development process is to determine the methodology to be used. This involves identifying the most appropriate methods and tools for the specific context and objectives of the scenario development process. The methodology should be selected based on the following criteria:

- **Relevance**: The methodology should be relevant to the specific context and objectives of the scenario development process.
- **Applicability**: The methodology should be applicable to the specific context and objectives of the scenario development process.
- **Feasibility**: The methodology should be feasible given the available resources (e.g. time, budget, expertise, data, etc.).
- **Transparency**: The methodology should be transparent and well-documented, allowing for replication and further analysis.
- **Flexibility**: The methodology should be flexible and adaptable, allowing for updates and adjustments as new information becomes available.
- **Accessibility**: The methodology should be accessible to a wide range of stakeholders, ensuring that it can be understood and used by non-experts.
- **Effectiveness**: The methodology should be effective in achieving the objectives of the scenario development process.
- **Efficiency**: The methodology should be efficient in terms of time, cost, and resources required to implement it.
- **Acceptability**: The methodology should be acceptable to stakeholders, ensuring that it is perceived as fair and legitimate.

The following table provides an overview of the methods and tools considered, along with a brief description of each and its relevance to the specific context and objectives of the FutuRaM scenario development process.  
[6.3. Methods and tools considered in the FutuRaM scenario development process](#63-methods-and-tools-considered-in-the-futuram-scenario-development-process)

#### 2.1.2. Choice of methodology

The grant proposal for the FutuRaM project outlined that there should be at least three scenarios developed, namely business as usual, recovery and circularity. This remains the case, however, during the scenario development process, additional scenarios, or scenario dimensions, were considered.

*Supply chain security:*
Due to various political developments in 2022, the question of the security of the EU's supply chains for CRMs was brought into focus. This led to the proposal from stakeholders to consider a scenario dimension that would explore the security of the EU's supply chains for CRMs.

*Energy transition:*
The energy transition is a key topic in the EU's policy agenda, and the FutuRaM project is concerned with the role of CRMs in the energy transition. Therefore, the proposal was made to consider a scenario dimension that would explore the energy transition in the EU.

**Multi criteria analysis and cross impact analysis**
In order to assess the potential of including these additional scenario dimensions, a multi criteria analysis and a cross impact analysis was conducted. In this process, the additional dimensions of supply chain security and energy transition were considered. The addition of extra dimensions adds increase the possible number of scenarios as n = (d*l)<sup>2</sup>, where n is the number of scenarios, d is the number of dimensions and l is the number of levels for the dimensions. Therefore, the addition of two extra dimensions each with three levels would increase the number of possible scenarios from 3 to 27. By assessing the consistency and plausibility of these combinations with a matrix based method, it was possible (mostly due to the close relationship between the energy transition and the three original scenarios) to reduce the number of scenarios to 9 (combinations with three levels of EU autarky in relation to raw materials).

Ultimately, however, it was decided to eliminate consideration of the supply chain security dimension, as it was felt that, while directly relevant to FutuRaM's scope, the consortium is not in a position to speculate on geopolitical developments. Attempting to include such developments would also add a significant degree of incertitude to the scenarios that we develop, which would make it more difficult to use them as a basis for the development of policy recommendations.

Concerning policy development related to the supply of CRMs to the EU, the utility of FutuRaMs modelling would come rather from the other perspective. That is, (given a certain supply of waste materials to the recovery system) the models and forecasts developed in FutuRaM could be used to make assessments about supply chain security based on the amount of raw material demand that could be met by the recovery system.

**Delphi method**
The Delphi method is a structured and iterative forecasting technique used to gather and aggregate the opinions of a group of experts or stakeholders on a particular topic. It is designed to achieve a consensus or convergence of opinions through a series of rounds of questionnaires or surveys.
This method was used in FutuRaM's scenario building process in the way of internal consultation consultation with consortium members who were experts with regard to their waste stream or to another aspect of the recovery system. Application of this method was instrumental in the development of the general storylines, as well as for identification and classification of the key elements of the scenarios. It is planned that the Delphi method will be used again, with the additional inclusion of external stakeholders to further refine the scenarios presented in this report.

The method involved the following steps:

- Selection of experts
- Generation of initial questionnaire
- First round of responses
- Analysis and feedback
- Iterative rounds
- Convergence and consensus building

#### 2.2.3. Choice of scenario type

The general types of scenario are summarize in the following table:

###### Table 2.2: Types of scenario (adapted from [Börjeson et al., 2005](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.futures.2005.12.002)) <!-- omit in toc -->

| Scenario category                            | Scenario type | Quantitative/qualitative                         | Time-frame      | System structure         | Focus on internal or external factors    |

<br>

The scenarios developed in the FutuRaM project are a combination of predictive and normative:

- BAU: *What will happen if current trends continue?*

  - This scenario is predictive in nature, as it is based on the assumption that the current trends and developments in the broader society and in particular, in the EU's waste management and resource recovery systems will continue into the future. In this scenario, legislative targets and mandates are not considered as endpoints. <br><br>
- Recovery: *What will it take to achieve the EU's targets for material use and recovery? - Focus on technology*

  - This scenario is normative (also called backcasting), and will include endpoints and midpoints that are based on the EU's legislative targets and mandates. The focus here will be on manipulating the technology and infrastructure of the recovery system in order to achieve the EU's targets and mandates. <br><br>
- Circularity: *What will it take to achieve the EU's targets for material use and recovery? - Focus on re-X strategies*

  - This scenario is a combination of normative and explorative, and will include endpoints and midpoints that are based on the EU's legislative targets and mandates, as well as the targets and mandates of the EU's circular economy action plan. The focus here will be on manipulating the re-X strategies of the recovery system in order to achieve the EU's targets and mandates. Since many of these re-X strategies are still in the early stages of development, this scenario will also be explorative in nature. <br><br>

### 2.3. Step 3: Marker scenario mapping  

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

#### 2.3.1. Justification and methodology  <!-- omit in toc -->

This preliminary step in the scenario development process involves conducting a literature study to identify existing scenarios that are relevant to the FutuRaM project. This step is crucial as it serves several important purposes and provides valuable insights for the overall scenario development process. It helps the scenario development team to build on existing knowledge, identify relevant scenarios, gain insights and inspiration, fill knowledge gaps, and enhance credibility and comparability.

*Building on existing knowledge:*
Conducting a literature study allows the FutuRaM project team to tap into existing knowledge and expertise in the field of waste management, resource recovery, and circular economy. It provides a foundation of existing scenarios that have been developed by other researchers, organizations, or institutions. By building on this existing knowledge, the FutuRaM project can leverage the insights, methodologies, and findings from previous scenario studies, saving time and resources.

*Identifying relevant scenarios:*
Marker scenario mapping helps identify scenarios that are relevant to the specific objectives and scope of the FutuRaM project. By reviewing the literature, the project team can assess the applicability of existing scenarios to their research questions and determine which scenarios align with the waste streams, sectors, and policy domains being considered. This step ensures that the scenarios selected for further analysis are well-suited to address the project's goals.

*Gaining insights and inspiration:*
Reviewing existing scenarios provides the FutuRaM project team with valuable insights and inspiration for the development of their own scenarios. It allows them to understand the different approaches, assumptions, and methodologies used in previous scenario studies. This knowledge can inform the design and structure of the FutuRaM scenarios, helping to ensure a rigorous and well-founded approach.

*Filling knowledge gaps:*
Marker scenario mapping helps identify any gaps or areas of limited knowledge in the existing scenario landscape. It allows the FutuRaM project team to identify topics or aspects that have not been adequately addressed in previous scenarios. This awareness of knowledge gaps can guide the project team in focusing their efforts on areas where new insights and contributions can be made, leading to a more comprehensive and innovative scenario development process.

*Enhancing credibility and comparability:*
By conducting a literature study and referencing existing scenarios, the FutuRaM project can enhance the credibility and comparability of their own scenarios. The project team can reference and compare their findings, assumptions, and results with those from previous studies, contributing to the overall body of knowledge in the field. This promotes transparency, robustness, and consistency in the scenario development process and allows for better benchmarking and evaluation of the FutuRaM scenarios.

[6.4. List of sources identified in the process of marker scenario mapping](#64-list-of-sources-identified-in-the-process-of-marker-scenario-mapping)  presents an overview of the marker scenarios considered in the FutuRaM project. The table is not intended to be exhaustive, but rather to provide an overview of the different scenarios that have been developed in the field of waste management, resource recovery, and circular economy.

<br>

### 2.4. Step 4: Identification of key drivers of change  

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

In this step, the key drivers of change that will shape the future of the scenarios are identified. Key drivers are the factors or forces that have a significant influence on the waste management system and its development over time. These drivers can be social, economic, technological, environmental, or policy-related.

The purpose of identifying key drivers of change is to understand the factors that will have the greatest impact on waste management and to ensure that the scenarios capture the range of possible outcomes influenced by these drivers.

The process of identifying key drivers involves a combination of literature review, expert consultations, and stakeholder engagement. It requires a comprehensive analysis of relevant trends, uncertainties, and emerging issues that may affect the waste management system.

The key drivers identified in this step will be used to develop the storyline themes and scenario parameters in the next step.

The following diagram illustrates the process of identifying key drivers of change:

![Figure 2.4.1: Process of identifying key elements for the storylines and scenarios](figures/fig_241.png)  

<br>

**Methodology and results of this stage for FutuRaMs scenario development:**
The overall goal of this process is to identify and include elements in the storylines and scenarios that are relevant, plausible, and influential in shaping the future. The selection, screening, and categorization steps ensure that the elements chosen for the development of storylines and scenarios are consistent, coherent, and aligned with the objectives and scope of the scenario exercise.  

1. **Preliminary collection:**
   This step involved gathering a pool of potential elements that could be included in the storylines and scenarios. These elements were derived from expert input from waste streams and the scenario development team including taking also knowledge from the literature review and existing scenarios identified in "Step 2 - Marker scenario mapping".  
   <br><br>
   This step was conducted using the [PESTLE analysis framework](https://pestleanalysis.com/pestel-framework/)
   The PESTEL (or PESTLE) framework is a strategic tool used to understand the macro-environmental factors that affect an system. A PESTEL analysis can help identify opportunities and threats linked to each of these factors, understand the broader context and shape scenarios accordingly.  
   <br><br>
   The acronym PESTEL stands for:  
   <br>
   • **Political**: These factors refer to the impact of government policies, regulations, and political stability. This includes issues like tax policy, labour laws, environmental regulations, trade restrictions and reforms, tariffs, and political stability.  

   • **Economic**: These factors relate to the broader economic environment, including factors like economic growth, exchange rates, inflation rates, interest rates, disposable income of consumers and businesses, and the general health of the economy.  

   • **Sociocultural**: These factors include societal trends and characteristics that could affect your business. They include demographic trends (like age, gender, and ethnicity), cultural trends, lifestyle preferences, consumer attitudes, and broader societal expectations.  

   • **Technological**: These factors refer to the impact of emerging technologies, research and development activities, automation, the rate of technological change, and the adoption of technology within your market.  

   • **Environmental**: These factors refer to ecological aspects that can affect a system. This includes environmental regulations, consumer attitudes towards sustainability, climate change, and other natural events.  

   • **Legal**: These factors include laws and regulations with which your business must comply. These can include labour law, consumer law, health and safety law, and restrictions on the import or export of goods.

   The number of elements at this stage was: 68  
   The following table lists the elements that were identified in this stage.  
   [6.5. List of drivers/factors identified in the initial collection phase](#65-list-of-driversfactors-identified-in-the-initial-collection-phase)   
   <br>  
  
2. **Screening:**  
  In the screening step, the collected elements are evaluated and assessed based on specific criteria. This evaluation helps determine the relevance, reliability, and significance of each element for the development of storylines and scenarios. Many elements were aggregated, especially if they were deemed to follow similar trends to others. Elements that did not meet the predefined criteria or were deemed irrelevant or unreliable were be excluded from further consideration.  

  The number of elements at this stage was: 28  
  The following table lists the elements that were identified in this stage.  
  [6.6. List of drivers/factors identified in the screening phase](#66-list-of-driversfactors-identified-in-the-screening-phase)  

  The following figure illustrates part of the screening process for the FutuRaM scenarios which was informed by the waste streams. In this exercise, the elements were evaluated based on their relevance to the waste streams and their potential impact on the waste management system. The elements were also assessed based on their plausibility and likelihood of occurrence in the future. The elements that were deemed relevant, plausible, and influential were included in the storylines and scenarios.

  ![Figure 2.4.2: Part of the screening process for elements to be included in the FutuRaM scenarios ](figures/figure211_screeningprocess.png)  
  
  <br><br>

  **Assessment**  
   Once the screening process was complete, the remaining elements were aggregated and categorised based on their thematic relevance or characteristics. This categorisation helps organize the elements into meaningful groups or themes that align with the objectives and scope of the scenarios.
   <br>  
   The number of elements at this stage was: 21  
   <br><br>
  
   **Categorisation**  
   The scenario elements were then assessed based on their potential impact on the waste management system. For each element, an assessment was made as to whether is was within the scope of FutuRaM to include them as variables in the models, and therefore also the scenarios and their storylines. Those deemed to be within the scope are 'internal' and will be intensively researched and modelled. Those deemed to be outside the scope are 'external' and will be included in the storylines, will vary over time, but will not vary across the three scenarios. Those deemed to be outside the scope and also outside the influence of the waste management system are 'outside' and will not be included in the storylines or scenarios.

   <br></br>

   **Justification for keeping elements outside of the scenario models:**  
   The purpose of the FutuRaM project is not to provide all-encompassing scenarios that attempt to capture every possible future development. Such scenarios are inherently inaccurate and can give a false sense of certainty to the model's outcomes. Instead, the focus of FutuRaM is specifically on the Sustainable Resource Management (SRM) system and its implications for the future. Therefore, the scenarios developed within FutuRaM should selectively incorporate elements that have a direct impact on the SRM system.
   <br></br>
   Furthermore, the scenarios should prioritize elements that can be considered as "policy knobs," meaning variables or factors that can be adjusted or controlled to test different settings. By including these policy knobs, the scenarios can explore the effects of different policy decisions or interventions on the SRM system's outcomes. This targeted approach ensures that the scenarios generated are relevant to the project's objectives and facilitate meaningful analysis.
   <br></br>
   It is crucial to avoid excessive complexity and convolution in scenario modelling. When there are too many convoluted elements included, the results of the modelling exercise can become, at best, difficult to understand and interpret. At worst, the outcomes may become practically useless due to the overwhelming interactions and uncertainties introduced by the complex elements. Therefore, careful consideration is necessary to strike a balance between incorporating essential factors and maintaining the clarity and usefulness of the scenario modelling results.  
   <br><br>

   **Examples:**  

   These elements are kept outside of the model due to considerations of reliability, predictability, and complexity. Including such elements within the model may introduce excessive uncertainty and make the model less reliable and predictable.  
   <br></br>
   *Resource shortages:*  
   Resource shortages can be highly unpredictable and subject to various external factors such as geopolitical events, natural disasters, or technological advancements. The precise timing and extent of resource shortages are challenging to forecast accurately, making it difficult to include them within the model without introducing significant uncertainty.  
   <br></br>
   *Raw material vs SRM prices:*  
   The dynamics and competition between raw materials and secondary raw materials can be complex and influenced by various market factors, technological advancements, and policy changes. These factors make it challenging to predict and model the specific price trends accurately, leading to increased uncertainty within the model.  
   <br></br>
   *Climate change impacts/mitigation:*  
   Climate change impacts and mitigation efforts involve a wide range of factors and uncertainties, including scientific projections, global cooperation, policy changes, and technological advancements. The complex interplay of these factors makes it difficult to model and predict the precise impacts and outcomes within a specific time frame.  
   <br></br>
   *International trade and cooperation (vs. autarky):*  
   International trade and cooperation are influenced by multiple geopolitical, economic, and policy factors. The dynamics of trade relationships, agreements, and collaborations can change rapidly, making it challenging to model and predict their outcomes reliably. Moreover, the decision-making and actions of multiple countries and stakeholders involved in international trade introduce convolution and complexity that is difficult to capture within the model.  
   <br></br>
   By keeping these elements outside of the model, it allows for a more reliable and predictable representation of the scenarios, focusing on factors that can be modelled with greater certainty and understanding.  
   <br></br>
   The number of INTERNAL elements identified as at this stage was: 12  
   The number of EXTERNAL elements identified as at this stage was: 9  
   <br>
   The following table lists the elements that were identified in this stage. The numeric rating in the columns "BAU", "REC" and "CIR" refer to estimates of the trends of the elements under each scenario.

### 2.5. Step 5: Develop storyline themes  

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

Given that the scenario themes and directions were broadly dictated by the the FutuRaM project charter, the rough shapes of the storyline narratives were already defined. That is: the effects on the availability of SRMs from the development of the SRM recovery system and the development of re-X strategies.

### 2.6. Step 6: Qualitative narrative development  

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

The scenario storylines will be described in detail in the next section. This step involved taking the themes defined by the charter and the elements identified in the previous steps and working with the internal waste stream groups to develop qualitative estimates about how each of these elements (at their different levels) may have an impact on the the amounts and composition of the SRM flows in their purview.

### 2.7. Step 7: Definition of scenario parameters  

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

The scenario parameters are the set of quantitative values or functions that will be used to define the scenario inputs for the model. These parameters will be defined in the next stages of the project.

### 2.8. Step 8: Quantitative modelling  

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

The scenario quantification will be performed in the next stages of the project.

### 2.9. Step 9: Implementation  

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

The scenario implementation will be performed in the next stages of the project.

### 2.10. Step 10: Review process  

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

The review process is intended to ensure that the elements included in the storylines and scenarios are relevant, plausible, and consistent with the scenario objectives and scope.

The first stage of the review process is to open the scenario development process to the wider FutuRaM consortium. This will be done by sharing the scenario development process and the results of the assessment and categorisation step with the consortium and inviting feedback and suggestions. The feedback will be used to refine the elements and their categorisation, and to identify any elements that may have been missed in the initial assessment.

The second stage will involve opening the scenario development process to external stakeholders and subject matter experts.

The scenario review process will be performed repeatedly over all stages of the project. This document is a living document and will be updated as the project progresses.

## 3. Scenario storylines

Back to [Table of Contents](#iii-table-of-contents)

### 3.1. Scenario 1: Business as usual

#### 3.1.1. Storyline narrative

This scenario envisions the future based on the current situation, extending to 2050 with very little deviation from present consumption patterns and the secondary raw material (SRM) system. While there may be advances in some areas such as resource efficiency, recovery technology, and the energy transition, substantial modifications remain hindered by economic, social, and political constraints. The primary extraction of raw materials continues to be the primary source to meet the EU's demand.

In the Business As Usual (BAU) scenario, we are projecting the trajectory of the present into the future, extending up to the mid-century mark, 2050, with minimal disruption to existing consumption habits and the secondary raw material (SRM) system. This scenario unfolds on the assumption that the current pace and direction of technological, economic, and social development continue unhindered, and is characterised by a strong persistence of today's patterns.

It is true that in this scenario, we might see marginal improvements in certain areas like resource efficiency, advancements in recovery technology, and a slow transition towards greener energy sources. However, these developments are only minor tweaks to the existing system, failing to disrupt or fundamentally alter the established structure. The potential for transformational change remains largely untapped due to various hurdles. Economic constraints, social resistance to change, political inertia, and entrenched interests act as barriers to change, stifling efforts towards a more sustainable SRM system.

Primary extraction of raw materials remains the dominant source for raw materials consumed in the EU, continuing the linear 'take-make-dispose' model of resource consumption. Recycling and recovery rates remain stubbornly low, resulting in significant SRM waste. Meanwhile, material demand continues to rise in tandem with GDP growth, further exacerbating the resource pressure.

Moreover, the environmental impacts of mining and extraction persist as a significant concern. These operations continue to degrade ecosystems, leading to loss of biodiversity and contributing to climate change. Simultaneously, the EU becomes increasingly dependent on imports of SRMs, raising concerns about supply chain security and geopolitical risks.

Innovation in SRM recovery technologies is hampered by a lack of investment and regulatory support. The focus remains predominantly on cost-effective material production and use, with little regard for environmental implications or long-term sustainability. Material scarcity and price fluctuations, therefore, may become a considerable risk to the EU industry, threatening economic stability.

Moreover, environmental regulations remain largely static, inadequately addressing emerging challenges or incentivising sustainable practices. The lack of regulatory progress may further exacerbate environmental damage and biodiversity loss. Working conditions in mining and extraction industries persist as challenging, with no significant improvements in labour rights or safety standards.

In essence, the BAU scenario is characterised by a continuation of current trends and practices, a future where the potential for a sustainable SRM system is unrealised due to the stranglehold of prevailing economic, social, and political constraints.

In the Business as usual (linear economy) scenario, the following are key characteristics:

- A forecasting model is used to predict the future based on the current situation and the development of existing trends.
- EU targets including those for recycling and recovery are not met, and the current linear model largely persists.
- Material demand keeps pace with GDP growth, perpetuating a trend of increasing consumption.Primary mining and extraction persist as the leading sources of raw materials, underlining the dependency on traditional extraction methods.

- The industrial focus remains on cost-effective material production and use, disregarding the long-term sustainability aspect.
- Material scarcity and price fluctuations pose potential risks to the EU industry, highlighting the vulnerability of this business model.
- Without any significant updates to environmental regulations, the negative impacts on ecosystems and biodiversity intensify.
- Working conditions in mining and extraction industries see no substantial improvements, highlighting continued issues of social inequality.
- Investment in new SRM recovery technologies remains minimal, stifling innovation and advancements in this field.  
- The EU's reliance on fossil fuels continues, with the energy transition progressing at a slow pace.
- The EU's dependency on imports of SRMs escalates, heightening the risk of supply disruptions.

In the recovery scenario, the central emphasis is on harnessing sophisticated technologies to salvage SRMs from waste streams at the end of their lifecycle. While there are noticeable strides towards the incorporation of 'circular design' principles and re-X strategies (which focus on reducing, reusing, recycling, repairing, and refurbishing), a vestige of wasteful consumerism, akin to the one observed in the BAU scenario, still lingers. However, this is somewhat mitigated by the implementation of a comprehensive material recovery system.

In this scenario, the central actor is the waste treatment sector, with the spotlight falling on the enhancement of recovery technology. The implementation and optimisation of cutting-edge technologies, such as Artificial Intelligence (AI), automation, and advanced robotics, play a significant role in revolutionising waste treatment processes.

### 3.3. Scenario 3: Circularity  

[Back to: **Table of Contents**](#iii-table-of-contents)

#### 3.3.1. Storyline narrative

In this scenario, we move in the direction of the maximum achievable state of material efficiency as government policy, private innovation and social changes are rapidly driving the transition toward a circular economy. The emphasis here rests heavily on re-X strategies that are implemented in the design phase of products (e.g., repairability and re-manufacturability) and that are actualised by changes in consumer behaviour (e.g reduction, refusal, engagement in the ‘sharing-economy’ and curtailment of the ‘throw-away’ mindset). Further, being enabled by the widespread adoption of ‘circular design’ principles and improvements in information transparency (e.g., waste tracking and digital product passports) the system for the treatment of post-consumer waste can divert a significant amount of their inflows (to, for example, re-use and re-manufacture) with the residual fraction being readily segregated into purer, more efficiently recoverable, material streams. This scenario envisions a future where government policies are in synergy with private sector innovation and societal changes, driving a wholesale transition towards a circular economy. Unlike the recovery scenario, where the focus is on the end-of-life recovery of materials, this scenario emphasises minimising waste at all stages, starting from the design phase itself.

The emphasis is on re-X strategies that are integrated right from the product design stage. This includes repairability, where products are designed to be easily fixed rather than replaced; and re-manufacturability, where products or their components are designed to be restored to their original state, extending their lifespan and reducing the need for new resources. This scenario calls for a drastic change in consumer behaviour, where reduction in consumption and waste, refusal of non-sustainable options, and active participation in the 'sharing economy' become the norm rather than the exception.

In the circularity scenario, the widespread adoption of 'circular design' principles becomes a cornerstone of production. In a circular design approach, products are designed and produced in a way that considers their entire lifecycle, including eventual disassembly and reuse. This means that every component of the product can either be biologically broken down without any harm to the environment or technically reprocessed into new products, creating a closed loop of materials.

Additionally, this scenario envisions an improvement in transparency, with measures such as waste tracking and digital product passports becoming standard. Waste tracking allows for efficient management of waste flows, aiding in effective resource planning, while digital product passports provide information about a product’s composition and how it can be properly disassembled, reused, or recycled.

This system is supported by the active engagement of all stakeholders in the value chain, from designers and manufacturers to consumers and waste managers. It is driven not only by technological advancements but also by systemic changes in policy and behaviour. A key aspect of this scenario is the shift from ownership to service-based models, where businesses retain ownership of their products and consumers pay for the service the product provides, encouraging businesses to design for longevity, repairability, and recyclability.

Thus, the circularity scenario underscores a comprehensive and systemic approach towards resource management, where every stage of the product lifecycle, from design to disposal, is optimised for sustainability and efficiency. It's not only about improving waste treatment but also about preventing waste generation in the first place. This scenario represents a holistic shift in economic and social systems, enabling a sustainable future where resources are never wasted, but instead, continually flow in a circular loop.

#### 3.3.2. Waste stream specific scenario impacts

- This scenario is characterized by meeting all material needs through recovery (including mineral wastes from other industries) with high material efficiency achieved through the development of new business models, advanced designs and recycling technologies, strict waste management regulations, and innovative products and services.  
- Plausible target: Achieving a 100% recovery rate of avoidable CDW by 2050, with a recycling rate accounting for 30% and component reuse accounting for 20%. Raw material consumption should be reduced by 50% compared to the 2020 level.  
- Example of treatment technological development: Waste concrete is primarily recycled through an innovative mobile dry process. Biodiesel-based thermal treatment is applied to further pyrolyze the fine aggregate to recover cement. Lightweight design is implemented to reduce concrete use.

##### SLASH (Slags and Ashes) <!-- omit in toc -->

In the circularity scenario, the approach to slags and ashes (SLASH) dramatically changes. Instead of being treated as waste, SLASH is seen as a valuable secondary raw material.

For ash from the incineration of solid biomass, maximizing the use of biomass by setting proper temperature, time, and furnace conditions to reduce ash contents and improve the efficiency of power and heat generation. For ash, developing other renewable technologies from bioenergy to reduce the incineration of solid biomass, e.g., biogas.  
- Reduce the generation of SLASH by increasing the proportion of higher calorific waste and decreasing lower calorific waste, e.g., MSW (Municipal Solid Waste).  
- Developing domestic feedstock supply for bioenergy or metal production to reduce the cost of transportation and others.  
- Higher formal collection and recycling rate compared to BAU, but lower compared to the Recovery scenario.

| SSP                      | Shared Social Pathways. They “describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The SSPs are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fuelled development, and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the SSPs depict a wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature.” |                                 | Marker scenario examples                                                | PBL, IEA and GEC                                                           |
